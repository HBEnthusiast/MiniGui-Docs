Alternative formats for MiniGui.chm

After a couple of years of frustration typing in very simple search terms in MiniGui.chm and returning zero results, I converted MiniGui.chm to several formats that are more convenient, at least for me.

The first 2 are Treepad formats.  

One of them, MiniGui.exe, is a self-contained executable Help file.  This, for me, is the most convenient format.


The second, MiniGui, is a common Treepad intermediate format for Importing and Exporting from and to Treepad.  

MiniGui.html is all of the Help Text in a single Html file.

Note that the converted Help files Minigui.exe and Minigui.hjt include only text, and not images.

These Help files are current as of 11/24/2021.
