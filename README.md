Alternative formats for MiniGui.chm

After a couple of years of frustration typing in very simple search terms in MiniGui.chm and returning zero results, I converted MiniGui.chm to several formats that are more convenient, at least for me.

The first 2 are Treepad formats.  One of them, MiniGui.exe, is a self-contained executable Help file.
